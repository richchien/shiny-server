Go to the [r-graph-catalog](https://github.com/jennybc/r-graph-catalog) GitHub repository.

The initial work on this project was facilitated by an [NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award](http://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/students-etudiants/ug-pc/usra-brpc_eng.asp).

#### Inspiration

We are inspired by the [R graph gallery](http://rgraphgallery.blogspot.ca) and [rCharts Gallery](http://rcharts.io/gallery/). Our goal is to create a simple and organized visual index of diverse ggplot2 graphs. Naomi Robbins' book provided a great set of figures to start with.

We are very interested in extending this catalog, possibly helping to revive to the dormant [R graph gallery](http://rgraphgallery.blogspot.ca).
